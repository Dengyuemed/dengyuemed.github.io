## Introduction

In recent years, governments around the world have successively introduced policies and funding programs to support rare disease research and orphan drug development.

From the European Union updating its rare disease strategy, to the United States expanding its orphan drug incentive mechanisms, to Asian countries accelerating reforms in regulatory approval and patient accessibility—these coordinated public actions point to a shared reality: although only a small fraction of rare diseases have mature treatment options, global society continues to devote substantial resources to their study and protection.

Today, thousands of rare diseases have been identified worldwide. Yet only about 5% have approved treatments. This means the vast majority of patients are still waiting for meaningful medical breakthroughs. It also means that the research, production, distribution, and accessibility systems surrounding orphan drugs are becoming an increasingly important component of the global public health infrastructure.

As a company deeply involved in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, **DengYueMed** is committed to promoting the accessibility of rare disease therapies, ensuring that research outcomes reach patients more efficiently and reliably.

## Why Have Rare Diseases Become a Global Public Issue?

Individually, each rare disease affects a relatively small population. Collectively, however, thousands of such conditions form a massive patient group. 

Globally, rare diseases affect hundreds of millions of people—many of them children, individuals with inherited disorders, and patients facing chronic, progressive illnesses. The social impact far exceeds the literal meaning of the word “rare.”

Rare diseases often share several defining characteristics:

- **Early onset and severe progression** – Many begin in childhood and may lead to lifelong disability.
- **Difficult diagnosis** – Diagnostic journeys are often long, complex, and resource-intensive.
- **Limited treatment options** – Most conditions lack targeted therapies and rely primarily on supportive care.

For these reasons, rare diseases are not merely medical challenges; they are ethical, social, and public policy issues. When market mechanisms alone fail to meet the needs of vulnerable minority populations, public intervention becomes necessary.

## Why Continue Investing When Only 5% Have Treatments?

From a traditional commercial perspective, rare disease research has long been viewed as high-risk with limited returns. Small patient populations, difficulty in recruiting clinical trial participants, and lengthy, costly development timelines kept orphan drugs on the periphery of pharmaceutical innovation.

However, over the past two decades, this perception has gradually shifted.

### 1. Scientific Breakthroughs Often Begin with Rare Diseases

Many major therapeutic pathways were first validated in rare disease research before being applied more broadly to oncology, immunology, and genetic disorders. Rare diseases frequently provide clearer mechanistic models, making them ideal starting points for precision medicine.

Landmark therapies such as gene therapy *Zolgensma*, RNA therapy *Spinraza* for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and enzyme replacement therapy *Cerezyme* for Gaucher disease have fundamentally altered the natural course of these conditions. These breakthroughs represent milestones in orphan drug development and demonstrate how innovation in small populations can influence the broader medical landscape.

### 2. Public Health Ethics Drive Institutional Commitment

Although rare disease patients represent a minority of the population, their unmet medical needs are often among the most urgent.

In response, governments have established institutional frameworks that include:

- Market exclusivity periods  
- Tax incentives  
- Accelerated review pathways  
- Targeted public funding  

These mechanisms enable therapies that might otherwise be commercially unviable to reach the market.

Sustained investment in orphan drugs reflects a broader ethical principle: allocation of healthcare resources should not depend solely on patient numbers, but also on the intrinsic value and dignity of life.

### 3. Rare Diseases as the Testing Ground of Biotechnology

Orphan drug development has increasingly become the entry point for advanced biotechnologies.

Gene editing, cell therapy, targeted molecular design, and precision diagnostics often undergo initial safety and efficacy validation in rare diseases with relatively well-defined mechanisms. Once validated, these technologies can expand into more prevalent conditions.

In this sense, investing in the “5% treatable” diseases is not merely an act of cost-bearing—it is the construction of scientific and institutional foundations for treating a far wider range of diseases in the future.

## Where Does the Public Value of Orphan Drugs Lie?

### 1. Transforming Individual Lives

For patients and families, an orphan drug can mean:

- From “no available treatment” to “manageable condition”
- From repeated hospitalization to participation in school and society
- From severely shortened life expectancy to meaningful long-term survival

Such transformations cannot be measured solely through economic metrics. They concern human dignity and the restoration of possibility.

---

### 2. Strengthening Healthcare Systems

Rare disease initiatives have driven the expansion of diagnostic networks, gene testing capabilities, and cross-regional research collaboration. These advancements enhance efficiency and precision across the entire healthcare system.

Technological pathways initially developed for small patient populations often become core infrastructure in modern medicine.

---

### 3. Advancing Global Pharmaceutical Cooperation

Because patient populations are geographically dispersed, rare disease research inherently requires international collaboration. Drug development, clinical trials, and regulatory coordination are increasingly global in nature.

Within this framework, a stable and compliant pharmaceutical distribution system is equally essential. Cross-regional supply chain coordination ensures that limited medical breakthroughs can reach every patient who needs them.

## Conclusion: When Medicine Faces the Fate of the Few

The compassion of an era’s healthcare system is measured not only by how many common diseases it cures, but by whether it continues striving for the fewest.

Although only about 5% of rare diseases currently have approved treatments, humanity continues to invest. This is not solely a scientific decision—it is a commitment to fairness, dignity, and hope.

Every link connecting research outcomes to patient access is vital.

DengYueMed, as a global pharmaceutical distributor deeply engaged in the supply and service of rare disease therapies, remains committed to transforming “medical breakthroughs” into real-world accessibility.

Orphan drugs may not immediately change the outcome of every rare disease. Yet they represent one of humanity’s most steadfast responses to vulnerability: even if only a small number of people are affected, we will not abandon the search for answers.
