Globally, thousands of rare diseases have been identified, yet only about **5%** currently have approved treatments.  

Despite this stark reality, governments, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies continue to invest heavily in orphan drug development.

From the European Union updating its rare disease strategy, to the United States expanding orphan drug incentives, to Asian countries accelerating regulatory reforms—public action across regions signals a shared recognition:

Rare disease research is no longer peripheral. It is becoming a structural component of modern public health systems.

## Why Has "Rare Disease" Become a Global Public Issue?

While each rare disease affects a small number of patients, collectively they impact **hundreds of millions of people worldwide**.

Their characteristics make them socially significant:

- **Early onset & severe progression** — Many begin in childhood and cause lifelong impairment  
- **Difficult diagnosis** — Long diagnostic journeys and highly specialized resources  
- **Limited treatment options** — Most rely only on supportive care  

Rare diseases are therefore not merely medical challenges.  
They are issues of **ethics, equity, and social responsibility**.

When market mechanisms alone cannot meet life-saving needs, public intervention becomes essential.

## Why Invest When Only 5% Are Treatable?

From a traditional business perspective, orphan drugs were long considered commercially unattractive:

- Small patient populations  
- High clinical trial recruitment difficulty  
- Long and expensive development cycles  

However, this perception has shifted dramatically over the past two decades.

### 1️⃣ Scientific Breakthroughs Often Begin with Rare Diseases

Many modern therapeutic pathways were first validated in rare diseases before expanding into oncology, immunology, and broader genetic disorders.

Examples include:

- Gene therapy **Zolgensma** for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)  
- RNA therapy **Spinraza** for SMA  
- Enzyme replacement therapy **Cerezyme** for Gaucher disease  

These treatments fundamentally altered disease trajectories and became historic milestones in orphan drug development.

Rare diseases often provide clearer genetic or mechanistic pathways, making them ideal entry points for precision medicine innovation.

### 2️⃣ Public Health Ethics Drive Institutional Investment

Rare disease patients are disproportionately children and individuals with severe genetic disorders.

Their unmet needs cannot be addressed by market logic alone.

As a result, many countries established:

- Market exclusivity incentives  
- Tax credits  
- Accelerated regulatory review  
- Dedicated research funding  

This reflects a deeper principle:

Healthcare allocation should not depend solely on patient numbers — it must also respond to the **intrinsic dignity of life**.

---

### 3️⃣ The Clinical Testing Ground of the Biotech Revolution

High-barrier technologies often complete early validation in rare diseases:

- Gene editing  
- Cell therapy  
- Targeted molecular design  
- Precision diagnostics  

Success in rare diseases frequently lays the technological foundation for treating more prevalent conditions.

In this sense, investment in the “5%” builds infrastructure for the future 95%.

## Where Does the True Public Value of Orphan Drugs Lie?

### Changing Individual Fates

For families, an orphan drug may mean:

- From “no treatment” to “manageable disease”  
- From continuous hospitalization to reintegration into school and society  
- From limited life expectancy to long-term survival  

This transformation transcends economic measurement.

It concerns dignity.

---

### Strengthening Healthcare Systems

Rare disease research drives:

- Advanced diagnostic networks  
- Expanded genetic testing  
- Cross-border clinical collaboration  

Technologies developed for small populations often become core infrastructure of modern medicine.

---

### Promoting Global Pharmaceutical Cooperation

Rare disease patients are geographically dispersed, requiring international collaboration in:

- Clinical trials  
- Regulatory communication  
- Drug distribution  

A stable and compliant supply chain is essential to ensure breakthroughs reach patients worldwide.

DengYueMed, as a global pharmaceutical distributor deeply involved in rare disease drug supply and service networks, works to transform “medical innovation” into “real accessibility.”

## Conclusion: When Medicine Faces the Fate of the Few

The compassion of a medical era is measured not only by how many common diseases it cures, but by its commitment to the fewest among us.

Although only 5% of rare diseases currently have treatments, humanity continues to invest — because this is not merely a scientific calculation.

It is a decision about fairness.  
About dignity.  
About hope.

Orphan drugs may not immediately solve every disease.  

But they represent humanity’s most steadfast response to vulnerability:

Even if only a very small number of people need them, we will not stop searching for answers.
